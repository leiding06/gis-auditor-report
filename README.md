# GIS Auditor Report

**GIS Auditor Report** is a QGIS plugin for auditing and validating vector layers.  
It allows users to define and run a series of essential validation checks across vector layers and standalone attribute tables within a QGIS project.
It helps users identify data quality issues by checking **shared keys**, **spatial relationships**, and **duplicate values**, with results available in clear, exportable reports.

## âœ¨ Key Features

Unlike rigid, project-specific QA tools, this plugin offers flexibility through user-defined checks:

1.  **Shared Key Match:** Validate that attribute values match between a **Source Layer** (and its selected field) and a **Target Layer/Table** (and its selected field).
2.  **Spatial Relationship Check:** Test for geometric integrity (e.g., Are all features in Layer A **`within`** features in Layer B? **`intersects`**, **`touches`**, etc.).
3.  **Duplicate/Uniqueness Check:** Identify non-unique values for a selected field across a layer, helping to enforce data integrity.
4.  **Vector-to-Table Check:** Perform attribute checks against non-spatial tables (like CSV files or database views).
5.  **Actionable HTML Report:** All errors and mismatches are compiled into a clearly formatted, downloadable HTML report for easy sharing and tracking.
