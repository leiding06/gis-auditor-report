# GIS Auditor Report

A powerful and user-friendly QA/QC plugin for validating vector data in QGIS. Configure duplicate, spatial, and exclusion-zone checks via a simple interface. Generate HTML reports, which can also be exported to PDF using your browser's print feature.

## Key Features

Unlike rigid, project-specific QA tools, this plugin offers flexibility through user-defined checks:

Flexible Check Selection: Freely add or remove validation checksâ€”you only run what you need, for each project.

Section 1: Duplicate Value Check: Detect non-unique attribute values in any layer.

Section 2: Spatial Relationship Check: Ensure child features (e.g., points) follow rules relative to parent features (e.g., polygons).

Section 3: Exclusion Zone Check: Detect target features violating restricted areas.

Automated Report Details: Every HTML report includes the generation timestamp and operator name, making results traceable and auditable.

Instant HTML Report: Generate and share a clean report immediately after running your checks. PDF format available in browser - Print to PDF.
